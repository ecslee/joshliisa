                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p><span id="our-story-o" class="firstletter">O</span>nce upon a time, Josh and Aliisa didn’t know each other. Weird! Fortunately, in the fall of 2014, our paths crossed through shared social groups and the same undergraduate Christian ministry. As we got to know each other,  through everything from rock-climbing to bothering our friends together, things just clicked!</p>
                        
                    <p>In the fall of 2015, Josh headed out to graduate school at UC Santa Barbara and left Aliisa to finish her senior year in chilly New Jersey. Still, even while we were on opposite coasts, our relationship flourished and deepened through many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many Skype calls and all the cross-country visits we could sneak in. At the end of May 2016, Josh flew out to Princeton to celebrate Aliisa's graduation... and ask her something very special.</p>
                    
                    <p class="img-wrapper col-xs-12" style="margin: 15px auto;">

                    </p>

                    <p>Now we're in our last stretch of long-distance as Aliisa finishes a year-long fellowship at International Schools Services, a non-profit in the Princeton area. We’re pretty excited to walk down the aisle this summer, then move to Santa Barbara to start a new life together!</p>

                    <p>The Community House is a beautiful brick and stone building, built in 1926 right on Moorestown’s Main Street. Today, it is a non-profit that serves the area for a wide range of community events.  We’ll have the building to ourselves for the afternoon; we’ll plan to do the ceremony on the beautiful front lawn, then move inside to the ballroom for our reception.

                    <p class="tidbit-q">Where was the proposal?</p>
                    <p class="tidbit-a">On the bridge over Carnegie Lake! The birds were singing, the sun was shining, and despite his fears, Josh didn’t accidentally drop the ring in the lake. Afterwards, we walked along the Tow Path, just us, glowing and sharing the first special excitement of being engaged. We went to sushi for dinner, then to a surprise party at the Bocarsly house! It was a 100% perfect day.</p>
                    
                    <p class="tidbit-q">Where are you going for your honeymoon?</p>

                    <p class="tidbit-q">Did you draw something for your save the date?</p>
                    <p class="tidbit-a"><a href="http://savethedate.joshandaliisa.com" target="_blank">Why yes</a>, thank you for asking! It is a picture of us lying in a field of flowers!</p>

                    <div class="tidbit-a">
                        <p>When we are in the same place, we’ve loved going out to sushi, visiting to museums, walking around, cooking together, rock climbing, just talking and watching Gordon Ramsay videos. </p>
                        <p>When we’re long-distance, we like hanging out on Skype and just chatting about our lives: what we’ve been up to, things we’ve been thinking about, podcasts we like, Gordon Ramsay videos, etc.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p class="tidbit-q">Favorite kind of music to listen to together?</p>
                    <p class="tidbit-a">Spotify year-end review tells us we’ve collectively listened to 89,654 minutes and that our favorite genres are stomp and holler, indie pop, folk-pop, and indie-folk. Soooo, we’re pretty cool.</p>
                    
                    <p class="tidbit-q">Something you are trying to get better at?</p>
                    <p class="tidbit-a">We both lose things all the time, so at least one of us needs to become a Finder ASAP.</p>
                    
                    <p class="tidbit-q">What's the most memorable trip you have taken together?</p>
                    <p class="tidbit-a">One of our favorite trips has been to beautiful Lolo, Montana for our friends Dan and Katherine's wedding! We went horseback riding, tubing down a lazy river, climbing up and down mountains... on this one hike together, Katherine’s brothers showed us all sorts of creeping and crawling wildlife, including a snake eating a giant frog. Memorable!</p>
                    
                    <p class="tidbit-q">What was your most memorable date?</p>
                    <div class="tidbit-a">
                        <p>The first one that comes to Aliisa’s mind happened in Santa Barbara! She and Josh went on a very beautiful, very fun and romantic surrey ride along the Californian coast. Aliisa got out at one point to find drinks, and when she came back, Josh was giggling and pedaling furiously away with the surrey. She had to run after him with some kind old gentleman watching and cheering, "Go go go, you can catch him!" It was very memorable.</p>
                        <p>Josh says, "I can’t remember any of our dates!"</p>

                    <p class="tidbit-q">Things you each bring to this relationship?</p>
                    <div class="tidbit-a">
                        <p>Josh brings audiobooks, science, amazing cooking abilities, a vast knowledge of random facts, tea-stained beverage containers everywhere, gorgeous sky-blue eyes, special and constant finger-cracking/whistling/drumming skills, “a memory like a steel trap,” an amazing ability to stay calm and kind under pressure, the best jokes around, and this little giggle he makes after his own jokes.</p>
                        <p>Aliisa brings books, dresses, color-coded spreadsheets, digital illustrations and drawings of small tigers, little piles of clothes around her room to keep life exciting, love for dogs and babies, constant singing, and long hair that gets everywhere but doesn’t bother anyone. Plus a sparkling sense of humor and flair for creativity. Plus great conversation and empathetic listening skills!</p>
